# Agriculture Platform (working title)

A web-based agricultural decision-support platform designed to help farmers in arid regions like Sonora, Mexico monitor crop health and water stress using satellite-derived vegetation data.

## Background
Agricultural regions in northern Mexico face chronic water scarcity and limited access to tools that turn environmental data into practical guidance. Many existing platforms are expensive or designed for technical users, making them inaccessible to small and medium-scale farmers.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a simple, accessible platform that transforms satellite vegetation data into intuitive visual indicators that support better irrigation and crop management decisions.

## Planned Features
- Weekly crop health status (healthy, stressed, critical)
- Comparison over time (up to 6 months)
- Visual dashboard optimized for non-technical users
- Spanish-first interface
- Optional integration with low-cost soil sensors (Arduino)

## Technical Approach
- Satellite imagery processed into vegetation indices
- Comparison against historical baselines to detect stress patterns
- Rule-based predictive logic (initial prototype)
- Modular architecture to allow future ML-based models

## Status
Early-stage development (research and MVP design).
